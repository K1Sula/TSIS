Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics).
His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire.
Einstein had a passion for physics from a young age and made significant contributions to the scientific community throughout his life.
In 1905, he published the theory of special relativity, which revolutionized the understanding of space and time and introduced the famous equation E=mc^2, expressing the equivalence of mass and energy.
In 1915, Einstein completed his theory of general relativity, which provided a new understanding of gravity as a curvature in the fabric of spacetime.
This theory has profound implications for our understanding of the universe, including the prediction of gravitational waves, which were observed for the first time in 2015.
Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which laid the foundation for the development of quantum theory.
He continued to work on various scientific problems and became an outspoken advocate for peace, civil rights, and nuclear disarmament.
Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire scientists and thinkers around the world.
